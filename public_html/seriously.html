				<p>We hope you've seen the fun in this site, as we intended. It was a gag project that we thought would give people a laugh, along with brightening up their day just a bit. We enjoy poking fun from time to time.</p>

This includes server hardware capabilities, software limitations, and bandwidth. There is no actual code dedicated to how well your internet runs while playing a game.</p>
